/*
  This file contains the full reference implementation of the PDPMS shell UI
  that the design team provided on 2025-06-24. It is NOT used in the build by default
  (so you can safely ignore compile-time errors until each dependency / module
  is completed). Copy pieces from here into running components as you progressively
  build out the app.
